Danilo: How dificult password should we put for the zip passwords?
TA: We can construct a zip password as a random 10 digits number which is added to the integer value coming from the 8 leftmost hexadecimal characters of the md5(student_email).
Danilo: Good suggestion. With fcrackzip they can crack those passwords either in 1 week or in few minutes (if they know where to start the search)

Leftmost int:
1184745343
